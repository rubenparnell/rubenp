    <h2>Basic Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn up to lessons.</li>
        <li>Be on time, ready for teaching.</li>
        <li>Teach content for the OCR examination board.</li>
        <li>Plan lessons before starting to teach.</li>
        <li>Provide tasks for students to complete in lessons.</li>
        <li>Read over slides and worksheets before using them to ensure they are suitable.</li>
        <li>Read the OCR specification to confirm the content being taught is accurate and relevant.</li>
        <li>Learn the content yourself. <em>(This will make it much easier for students to learn.)</em></li>
        <li>Provide clear instructions and tasks to complete.</li>
        <li>In the <strong><em>unlikely</em></strong> event that the teacher cannot attend a lesson, suitable work must be set in advance. This work should be reviewed by the teacher to ensure it is appropriate and achievable (e.g. any provided links still exist, etc.). Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action (e.g. an after-school detention).</li>
        <li>Set homework tasks regularly, providing constructive feedback.</li>
        <li>Prepare students for assessments and mock exams with relevant revision resources and practice questions.</li>
        <li>Test students on topics that have been covered in class with appropriate assessments.</li>
        <li>Mark assessments promptly and accurately.</li>
        <li>Provide detailed and constructive feedback to support student progress.</li>
        <li>Encourage students to ask questions and seek help when needed.</li>
